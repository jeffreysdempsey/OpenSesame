Garage door opener with video feed: hybrid Ember-Cordova app with video feed and Raspberry Pi server.

**Executive Project Summary - What are you doing and why?**
  I will develop an Android app that controls two garage door openers and provides a video feed to check the open/close status of the doors.
  I am developing this app in particular to better learn how to make a hybrid Ember-Cordova app. The web side of the app will be served on a Raspberry Pi.
  The Pi will also serve as the video feed source with a camera module and serve a live video feed sans audio to the app. Additionally, the Pi will interface
  with the garage door openers themselves through relays (one relay per opener).

**Goals and Objectives**
  *Develop a Raspberry Pi webserver.

**Merit of the Project**

**Project timeline - When will you do it?**

**Define the major tasks and expected time to completion**

**Create and submit a Gantt chart**

**Project-oriented risk list - What could go wrong in the project and why?**

**Application requirements - What does your app/product do?**

**User stories**
  *As a home owner, I can remotely view the status of my garage doors and control them.
  *

**Misuser stories**
  *As a malicious hacker, I want to gain unapproved access to the garage door opener via Bluetooth/BLE pairing.
