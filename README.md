**Executive Project Summary - What are you doing and why?**
**Goals and Objectives**
**Merit of the Project**
Garage Doors I will develop an Android app that controls two garage door openers and provides a video feed to check the open/close status of the doors.
  I am developing this app in particular to better learn how to make a hybrid Ember-Cordova app. The web side of the app will be served on a Raspberry Pi.
  The Pi will also serve as the video feed source with a camera module and serve a live video feed sans audio to the app. Additionally, the Pi will interface
  with the garage door openers themselves through relays (one relay per opener).
Develop an Apache Cordova server to host webview for hybrid app on the Raspberry Pi.
