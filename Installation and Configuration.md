### Install from APK
*Know that installing APKs from unknown sources poses a security risk. Know what you're doing and why you're doing it. I bear no responsibility if you manage to brick or otherwise damage your phone installing this or something else on your phone.*

1. To install, you'll have to side load the .apk. To enable installing apps not from the Play Store, go to Settings>Security scroll down and toggle the switch for the option "Unknown Sources". Alternatively, you can just search the settings for "unknwon sources."
